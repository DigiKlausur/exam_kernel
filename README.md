# exam_kernel

A wrapper for the IPython kernel that sanitizes the input before execution.

This kernel blocks all magic commands including ```!```.

The libraries a user can use can be restricted by blocking or allowing certain imports. The module ```importlib``` is blocked by default.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/DigiKlausur/exam_kernel
cd exam_kernel
pip install .
python -m exam_kernel.install --sys-prefix
```

## Configuration

You can configure the kernel via the ```ipython_config.py```.
This file is usually located under ```~/.ipython```.

### 1. Initialization Code

This is the code that will be executed every time the kernel is initialized and set via the configuration option ```init_code```.

Example config:

```
# sample ipython_config.py

c = get_config()

c.ExamKernel.init_code = 'import random'
```

In this example the library ```random``` is imported every time the kernel is initialized, making it available to the user right away.

### 2. Allowed Imports

If you want to allow the user to only use certain libraries, you can specify them using the ```allowed_imports``` configuration option. All other libraries will be blocked by default if this option is set.

Example config:

```
# sample ipython_config.py

c = get_config()

c.ExamKernel.allowed_imports = ['math', 'numpy', 'scipy']
```

In this example the student can only import the libraries ```math```, ```numpy``` and ```scipy```. If the user tries to import any other library (e.g. ```matplotlib```), he or she will see the following message:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-5-041c468338fc> in <module>
----> 1 raise ModuleNotFoundError('No module named matplotlib or matplotlib blocked by kernel.')

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named matplotlib or matplotlib blocked by kernel.
```

### 3. Blocked Imports

If you want to block the user from importing certain libraries, but let them use all others, you can use the ```blocked_imports``` configuration option. 

**If the ```allowed_import``` option is used, the blocked imports will take no effect.**

Example config:

```
# sample ipython_config.py

c = get_config()

c.ExamKernel.blocked_imports = ['math', 'numpy', 'scipy']
```

In this example the student can not import the libraries ```math```, ```numpy``` and ```scipy```. If the user tries to import a blocked library (e.g. ```math```), he or she will see the following message:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-5-041c468338fc> in <module>
----> 1 raise ModuleNotFoundError('No module named math or math blocked by kernel.')

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named math or math blocked by kernel.
```
